# Australian-Lotto-Number-Generators
Scripts that can be used to choose random numbers for Australian Lotteries

Feel free to add any other cool scripts that may be useful for Australians wanting to play the various lotto games. Some scripts that pull data from previous draws to determine probability would be cool.
